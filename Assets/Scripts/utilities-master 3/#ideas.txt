create a generic list var and list reference, inherit from that

some sort of UI generator class that takes a generic input, contains a prefab version of itself

the cubicle object class for example in mount could be an instance of a new "commodity" class, which costs value and has effects/integer modifiers etc?
	- could also be a basis for objectui?
